# E-commerce-back-end
Hello, in this project I made a backend for a E commerce store using object relational mapping, you can view the code by using insomnia. If you would like to view a video verison of this tutorial you can do so here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GmNJcB4p-pacO_Zv6_NFGypp_KxvOzoV/view

## Starting off

Once the code is downloaded you will have install .env, set up the .env file with your sql username and password. You can see how the .env file is properly set up by looking at the .env example file. When that is done source the schema.db file like so.

Next put "npm run seed" in terminal to seed the database.

After run "npm start" or "node server.js" in terminal to start the server.

All you have to do now is load up insomnia and go to "http://localhost:3001/api/", Tags, Categories, Products. In insomnia each of these three can be found, updated, deleted and created, depending on what you want.
